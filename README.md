# Vulkan Non-Euclidean Ray Tracing

This was made for my Final Year Project at Univeristy, and was originally worked on between October 2023 - Feburary 2024, with some small updates added in May 2024.

This project also won 1st Prize for The Red Kite Games Award for Game Technology at The Game Republic Student Showcase 2024 and 1st Place in the Games Programming category at GradEX 25th Anniversary at Staffordshire University.

It contains a basic scene rendered with Ray Tracing and a few different types of Non-Euclidean objects, which are portals (with rotated and scaled portals), a hallway that is scaled differently on the inside, and a few different types of 3-Manifolds.

The main idea for this project was to figure out and document how to create non-Euclidean effects in a real time ray tracing application, even though now it may not have the best performance on the average graphics card, it may be useful in the future when graphics cards are powerful enough to handle complex scenes with these non-Euclidean effects.

This was also my first time using Vulkan so some of the code (specifically in Application.h/cpp) may be a little messy, if I had the time to update it then I would probably rewrite the whole thing now that I know how Vulkan works.
